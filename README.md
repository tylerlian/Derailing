# UNRAILED
by Tyler Lian & Koichi Kodama
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Instructions:

You play as Megaman who is trying to lead the train from one station to another.
To create the path for the train, you need to obtain wood from the trees in the level
and bring it to the forge which will supply you with rails to place for the train.
Once the train has reached the next station, you win the game, but be careful there
are goblins in the area who are trying to steal the wood so you can not build the rails,
so build fast.

## Controls:

Movement: Use the arrow keys to move up, down, left, and right.

Use Key: The shift key is the multi-purpose use key

1. When near a tree, the shift key will cut down the tree and put wood in your inventory

you are currently on.
